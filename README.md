# react-ts-template
This is a project I made as a part of my learning process, it is a simple template with React, TS, eslint, vitest, testing-library setup. We make use of <a href="https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/#basic-rules">Airbnb React Style Guide
</a> for linting rules, spacing and other requirements to setup a standard React, TS project.

I would like to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/cchqeWY0Nak">CodingGarden</a> for making an informative tutorial.
